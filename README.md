    </center>

  In order to use RKNPU, users need to first run the RKNN-Toolkit2 tool on the computer, convert the trained model into an RKNN format model, and then inference on the development board using the RKNN C API or Python API.

- RKNN-Toolkit2 is a software development kit for users to perform model conversion, inference and performance evaluation on PC and Rockchip NPU platforms.

- RKNN-Toolkit-Lite2 provides Python programming interfaces for Rockchip NPU platform to help users deploy RKNN models and accelerate the implementation of AI applications.

- RKNN Runtime provides C/C++ programming interfaces for Rockchip NPU platform to help users deploy RKNN models and accelerate the implementation of AI applications.

- RKNPU kernel driver is responsible for interacting with NPU hardware. It has been open source and can be found in the Rockchip kernel code.
